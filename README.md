**ðŸŽ¥ Exploring 39 Years of Pixar Magic with Power BI ðŸ“Š
**


Pixar has revolutionized the animation industry with its storytelling, innovation, and unforgettable characters. As part of the Maven Analytics Pixar Challenge, I created this interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the studio's movies, box office performance, reviews, and awards. From Toy Story to Inside Out 2, this dashboard provides insights into revenue, profitability, and audience reception. This marks my first time participating in one of Mavenâ€™s challenges.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

âœ… Total revenue: $17.04B

âœ… Academy Awards: 18

âœ… Highest-grossing movie: Inside Out 2 ($1.7B)

âœ… IMDbâ€™s highest-rated Pixar movie: WALL-E, Coco (8.40/10)

âœ… Return on costs: 281%

This project challenged me to apply data visualization, storytelling, and analytics to bring insights to life!
